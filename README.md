# Predicting Coffee Ratings Using Naive Bayes

## Overview
This project implements a Naive Bayes classification model from scratch to predict coffee ratings based on attributes such as roaster, roast level, origin, price, and textual review data. The model classifies coffee as either average (class 0) or outstanding (class 1).

## Methodology
The Naive Bayes algorithm operates under the assumption of feature independence and applies Bayesâ€™ Theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between features. The steps followed include:

1. **Preprocessing Textual Data**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization using NLTK.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Using TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features.
3. **Feature Selection**: Applying SelectKBest with ANOVA F-value to select the most relevant features.
4. **Model Implementation**: Training a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using scikit-learn.
5. **Evaluation**: Measuring performance using accuracy and F1-score through cross-validation.

## Evaluation & Results
The final evaluation of the model produced:
- **Accuracy**: 95.97%
- **F1-Score**: 95.39%

The optimal number of attributes selected was 161. This model achieved high validation scores with minimal discrepancies between training and validation scores, demonstrating generalizability and robustness.
